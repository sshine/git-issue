{"DescriptionChanged":{"old_description":"\nThe -n/--author-name and -e/--author-email parameters seem broken / like they don't do anything.\n\nINVESTIGATION RESULTS:\nThe parameters work when combined with actual changes, but there's a usability issue:\n\nPROBLEM: When users run 'git-issue edit <ID> --author-name \"XYZ\" --no-editor' without specifying other changes, the command reports 'No changes made' and doesn't do anything.\n\nEXPECTATION: Users might reasonably expect that specifying author parameters would result in some kind of action or at least a different message explaining that no field changes were specified.\n\nCURRENT BEHAVIOR: Author parameters are only applied when there are actual field changes (title, description, status, priority, labels, assignee).\n\nPOSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:\n1. Better error message when only author params are specified\n2. Allow author-only changes to update some metadata\n3. Documentation clarification about when author params are used\n","new_description":"Replace confusing --author-name and --author-email parameters with a single -c|--creator <EMAIL> flag that allows updating the created_by field of an issue (following the same pattern as -a|--assignee).\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. ✅ Add CreatedByChanged event type to IssueEvent enum\n2. ✅ Update Issue::apply_event() to handle CreatedByChanged events  \n3. ✅ Add update_created_by() method to IssueStore\n4. ✅ Replace author_name/email fields with creator field in EditArgs\n5. ✅ Update edit command logic to use creator flag\n6. ✅ Add tests for creator functionality\n7. ✅ Update issue description and test the fix\n\n## Usage\n\nThe new creator flag works like the assignee flag:\n- Use  to change the creator of an issue\n- The change creates a CreatedByChanged event in the issue history\n- No-op if the creator email is already the same","author":{"name":"Simon Shine","email":"simon@simonshine.dk"},"timestamp":"2025-07-30T14:56:51.380059Z"}}
