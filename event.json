{"DescriptionChanged":{"old_description":"The -n/--author-name and -e/--author-email parameters seem broken / like they don't do anything.\n","new_description":"\nThe -n/--author-name and -e/--author-email parameters seem broken / like they don't do anything.\n\nINVESTIGATION RESULTS:\nThe parameters are actually working correctly. They set the git commit author for issue events.\n\nTo verify this works:\n1. Make an edit with custom author: git-issue edit <ID> --priority high -n 'Test Author' -e 'test@example.com' --no-editor\n2. Check the commit author: git log refs/git-issue/issues/<ID> --pretty=format:'%h %an <%ae> %s'\n\nThe CLI output doesn't show the event author in the 'show' command, but the git commits are correctly authored.\n","author":{"name":"Simon Shine","email":"simon@simonshine.dk"},"timestamp":"2025-07-30T14:24:22.053490Z"}}
