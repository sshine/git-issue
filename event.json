{"Created":{"title":"Reintroduce --author-name/--author-email","description":"I've made a mistake in the commit e07f026f4016644dc6f6471c994d00cde9fde728: I got rid of --author-name and --author-email. They're necessary, and should not have been replaced by -c|--creator: The creator is metadata for the issue, but author is metadata of the event log, and I realize that all commands have these and should have these.","author":{"name":"Simon Shine","email":"simon@simonshine.dk"},"timestamp":"2025-07-30T17:21:34.694034Z"}}
