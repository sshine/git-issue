{"DescriptionChanged":{"old_description":"\nThe -n/--author-name and -e/--author-email parameters seem broken / like they don't do anything.\n\nINVESTIGATION RESULTS:\nThe parameters are actually working correctly. They set the git commit author for issue events.\n\nTo verify this works:\n1. Make an edit with custom author: git-issue edit <ID> --priority high -n 'Test Author' -e 'test@example.com' --no-editor\n2. Check the commit author: git log refs/git-issue/issues/<ID> --pretty=format:'%h %an <%ae> %s'\n\nThe CLI output doesn't show the event author in the 'show' command, but the git commits are correctly authored.\n","new_description":"\nThe -n/--author-name and -e/--author-email parameters seem broken / like they don't do anything.\n\nINVESTIGATION RESULTS:\nThe parameters work when combined with actual changes, but there's a usability issue:\n\nPROBLEM: When users run 'git-issue edit <ID> --author-name \"XYZ\" --no-editor' without specifying other changes, the command reports 'No changes made' and doesn't do anything.\n\nEXPECTATION: Users might reasonably expect that specifying author parameters would result in some kind of action or at least a different message explaining that no field changes were specified.\n\nCURRENT BEHAVIOR: Author parameters are only applied when there are actual field changes (title, description, status, priority, labels, assignee).\n\nPOSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:\n1. Better error message when only author params are specified\n2. Allow author-only changes to update some metadata\n3. Documentation clarification about when author params are used\n","author":{"name":"Simon Shine","email":"simon@simonshine.dk"},"timestamp":"2025-07-30T14:29:36.544146Z"}}
